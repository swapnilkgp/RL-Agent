The "gridworld.py" contains all the information about the grid environment. If we want to change the environment(e.g. the coordinates of obstacles, the starting and the ending positions, the region of wind and its speed in various regions) then we will have to just change the respective values in the "gridworld.py" file.

The "agent.ipynb" file contains the complete code that uses Reinforcement Learning to predict the 
optimal path in the environment.

The "path.jpeg" file will finally help us to visualise the optimal path that our agent will follow.

The "Documentation.docx" contains explanation of the whole code written in the "agent.ipynb" file.
